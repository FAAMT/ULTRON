# Project Name: ULTRON
About: This project is about a ROS based system I developed that uses a Raspberry Pi (3B+) along with a camera, lidar, and some motors to give it basic functionality. The purpose of this repository is for documentation, it should be noted that not all software is my intellectual property and I will do my best to document all these other sources.

For now, here is "ULTRON" fully assembled: <br />

Here is the Fusion360 version of him: <br />

Note: I made a last minute decision to orient his camera the other way around which is why the images may not be consistent with each other. I found that the lidar occupied too much space in the camera frame. I will upload his code as soon as I gather all the necessary reference to the other repos I have used in the making of this project.
