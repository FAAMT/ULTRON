# Project Name: ULTRON
About: This project is about a ROS based system I developed that uses a Raspberry Pi (3B+) along with a camera, lidar, and some motors to give it basic functionality. The purpose of this repository is for documentation, it should be noted that not all software is my intellectual property and I will do my best to document all these other sources.

For now, here is "ULTRON" fully assembled:
