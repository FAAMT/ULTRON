# Project Name: ULTRON
** About:** This project is about a ROS based system I developed that uses a Raspberry Pi (3B+) alogn with a camera, lidar, and some motors to give it basic functionality. The purpose of this repo is purely for documentation, it should be noted that not all software can be considered my intellectual property as I have used some template code from other sources on the internet. I will do my best to document all these other sources.
